1. In the min.c program, variable MAXINT did not declared and did not initialized, For that i just removed that and assign Array's 0th element as currmin.
	And also, comparision logic was wrong. If the Array[i] less than currmin then only currmin will be updated by Array[i] value.

2. In the corrupt.c program, integers i,j did not initialized and used. And also when we run the code, there is an additional @ sign comes in.
	Don't know why. So i just increase the char array's length by 1.

3.  In numbers.c program, Double quotetions has to be used for String.

4. In theta.c program, NULL is the keyword. We can use none of the KEY WORDS to declar variables, class name, functions etc.
